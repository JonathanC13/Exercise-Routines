* revise
* should not be calling other controllers. move to middleware? yes and have the differenct controllers use the common middleware. add what data each middleware needs to use and pass.

Run queries in group
// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74913957/if-one-of-the-multiple-queries-running-one-after-another-fails-in-mongoose

For a route that requires multiple DB calls:
    1. In the middleware, add the queries to like req.queries = []
    2. in the controller, start a mongoose session and try to commit them all or nothing.

1. Routine router
    - get all   (user_id comes from prev middleware that decodes the JWT for the user_id and puts into req.userId)  * Done
        - for list
    - get one (route param :id) * Done
        - for edit page
    - post one (get user Id from req.userId)    * Done

    - update one (route param :id) * Done
    - delete one (route param :id)  * Done
        - Need middleware
        - also delete all sessions, exercises, comments 
        middleware steps:
        1. delete Routine in routine controller
            req.routineId = the deleted routine id
            next()
        2. delete session in session controller that match the req.routineId
            Since exercises are a subdoc of session, exercies will be deleted here. But need the exercise Ids
            req.exerciseIds = [array of all the exercise IDs that belonged to this session]
            next()
        3. delete comments in the comment controller that match the req.exerciseIds 
            res.status(OK) success
        4. In controller run session * Done


        **TODO TEST AGAIN when session, exercise, and comment routes are done **
        They also use the same middleware. 

2. Session router
    - get all
    - get one
        - for edit
    - post one
    - update one
    - delete many: can have many since if a routine is deleted, then the many sessions will be deleted. if only one session needs to be deleted, all _ids are unique
        1. delete session in session controller that match the req.routineId
            Since exercises are a subdoc of session, exercies will be deleted here. But need the exercise Ids
            req.exerciseIds = [array of all the exercise IDs that belonged to this session]
            next()
        2. delete comments in the comment controller that match the req.exerciseIds
            res.status(OK) success

    ** Done
    ** TODO
    Test all session api

3. Exercise router
    - get all
        1. get all sessions in session controller 
        2. get all exercises from each session
    - get one
        - edit page
    - post one
    - update one
        1. update session in session controller with new exercise list. Array map
    - delete (no db query)
        1. update session in session controller with new exercise list. Array map
        2. delete comments in the comment controller that match the req.exerciseIds
            res.status(OK) success

4. Comments
    - get all
    - get one
    - post one
    - update one
    - delete many: if exercise is deleted, the many comments that have that exercise _id are deleted. if only one comment needs to be deleted, it will only match one.
