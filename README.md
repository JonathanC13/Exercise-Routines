## Description
I took my sweet time learning and applying bits and pieces of the MERN stack to create a glorified to-do list. 

The application enabled a user to:
1. Create multiple number of routines, where each can include *x* number of sessions. 
2. Each session created can include *y* number of exercises.
3. Then finally, each exercise created can include *z* number of sets.

Objectively, a worse evolution of a to-do list since it has enforced rigidity to conform to the Routines-Sessions-Exercises-Sets relationships. At the time, it was the only idea I could conjure because of how hollow my skull is and how inactive my body is.

All in all, the project was enjoyable to work on because I could engage with the entire system, the front end activated my eyes and the back end tickled my neural synapses, contrary to the fact this project's duration was egregiously long. I must have short circuits in my brain. Learning, applying, and creating something is a great time until my mental demon slinks out of its trench to whisper, "wHat's ThE poINT?"
